I am tracking predictions from mostly dissident right spheres
(defined extremely broadly)
as well as predictions from other circles that I take an interest it.
I am tracking predictions that I naturally encounter,
but if my Twitter account follows you and use the word “predict” or the phrase
“screenshot this” I will probably find it and add it if applicable.
You can also mention/tag me at my current account:
[@{{ social.twitter }}](https://twitter.com/{{ social.twitter }}).

NOTE: I reserve the right to reject predictions for any reason or no reason at all.
It is important that I reserve this right because this activity is subject to great abuse.

### Prediction Resolution

The prediction resolution process goes in the following steps,
which begin once I determine that a prediction is ready for resolution.

1. I identify the prediction and assert that it is entering resolution.
1. I calculate the points “wager” according to the matrix (described below).
1. I make a determination as to whether or not the prediction is true of false.
1. If applicable, I apply any bonus points or modifiers (described below).
1. If necessary, any special rules are applied.
1. I assign positive or negative Cobblepoints to the maker of the prediction and add it to a running tally.

### Prediction Wager Matrix

The intial wager of a prediction is calculated with the following points
(many times, only SIGNIFICANCE is considered).

| Category | Points | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SIGNIFICANCE | 1-5+ | An estimation of how signficant/historic/”game-changing” the predicted event is (or would have been if true). |
| CONFIDENCE | (-2)-2 | Up to 2 points can be subtracted for hedging and added for high confidence. Phrases like “screenshot this” add an automatic +1. |
| SPECIFICITY | (-2)-2 | Up to 2 points can be subtracted for highly vague predictions or added for highly specific ones. |

### Bonus Points

Additional points can be added/subtracted if the resolution of “true” of “false” is modified in any of the following ways:

* SPECTACULARLY FALSE: 1 point *added* to incurred point penalty.
* ALMOST TRUE: 1 point *removed* from point penalty.
* KINDA TRUE: 1 point *removed* from point award.
* SPECTACULARLY TRUE: 1 point *added* to point award.

### Special Rules

#### One Point Minimum

Every prediction resolution must result in a change of points.
The wager cannot be 0 points (if the wager would be 0 points,
the prediction should be discarded).
If the application of bonus modifiers leads to result of 0 points,
the output will be modified to +1 point for true predictions
and -1 point for false ones.

#### One-Sided Predictions

Some predictions can only be solved one-way. For example,
“someday X will happen” can never be resolved as false and
“X will never happen” can never be resolved as true.
If such a prediction is resolved,
there is a 2 point maximum to any point awards/penalties.

Most predictions imply a reasonable time limit,
so many predictions will escape this rule even if they appear open-ended.

#### 2020 Elections Default Point Values

These are the default point values in the SIGNIFICANCE category
for 2020 predictions:

* A person will win a House of Representatives contest (general or primary) or a party will win control of the House: 2 points.
* A person will win a Senate contest (general or primary) or a party will win control of the Senate: 3 points.
* A person will win the Presidency or a primary: 4 points.
* A party will win the Presidency (w/o specifying candidate): 3 points.
* All local election win predictions are for 2 points.
* Saying that a person/party will lose (instead of win) may be worth 1 less point than it would be if you predicted a win.

### Important Disclaimers

*This prediction activity is not conducted in a scientific enough manner to be used to draw conclusions about the trustworthiness of a person based on their Cobblepoints.*

*My assignment of positive points to a person should not be construed as an endorsement. My assignment of negative points to a person is not an attack and should not be construed as “infighting”.*
